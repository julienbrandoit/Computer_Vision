# Cell Detection and Counting in Microdroplets

## Overview
Welcome to the GitHub repository for the project undertaken as part of the ELEN0016-2 course. This project focuses on detecting and counting cells within microdroplets. Utilizing a computer vision solution, the project explicitly avoids the use of machine learning techniques. You can find a poster in the repository summarizing the entire methodology.

## Details
The solution presented in this project can be adapted for various types of detections, counting, and tracking of 'small circles' within 'larger circles'. Please note that the original videos are not provided in the repository.

For more details, refer to the poster available in the repository.
