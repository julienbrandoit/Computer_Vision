== Dependency ==
To execute our code, you will need some libraries:
1. libtiff
    > sudo apt install libtiff-dev
2. OpenMP
    > sudo apt install libomp-dev


== Execution ==
To execute the code you can use the following command
    > make run args="<start_sequence> <Number_of_video> [number_of_thread]"

- So if you want to applie BGS for video 1-1 to 5-3 with 6 threads you can use
    > make run args="1 15 6"

Note:
- The videos should be in the folder 'in'
- The mask will be place in the folder 'out'
- Thread is an optional parameter. If not specified, it will run the code sequentially

If you want to use different paths from 'in' and 'out' you can use
    > make custom args="<path_input> <path_output> <start_sequence> <number_of_video> [number_of_thread]"


== Mention ==
The code in timer.c and the function 'handel_error' in 'ViBe_segmentation.c' has been copy/paste from a code given in the course parallel programming. We did copy this code because it is simple and have no impact on what was ask for this project.


== Quick description ==
- ViBe_segmentation.c is the main file. It will perform the segmentation step as explain in the report
- ViBe_model.c have some function to compute the background model from a video. Some functions of this file are not used for this part of the project, but are keept because we use them for other purposes. 
- ViBe_common.c define some function used by other file such as load/save tiff file
- timer.c give two function to get a timer
